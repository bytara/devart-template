Project considerations and sketches.

A gallery viewer walks into the space to hear soft harp music playing.  This is recorded sound.  In the middle of the room there sits a harp with a chair.  There may be sheet music or a general information sheet about the notes of the strings.

Guests are invited to sit down and play the strings.  The harp will be fixed to the ground to prevent accidental tipping.  When a string is played, the recorded sound stops (this may be handled with a microcontroller, such as arduino).  The harp sound will be amplified, filling the space.  

As the sound fills the room, it is transformed into projected visualizations.  

“The perfect harmonics produced by a plucked harp string create a waveshape that is the sound equivalent of white light.”  -Sarajane Williams, The Mythic Harp

There will be two projections, representing the two hemishperes of the brain, similarly our two ears, the stero sound that we hear.  As the sounds vibrate and merge, the visual projections settle and merge as well.


The String Theory Project focuses on strings because of the uniquenes of the sound vibrations through the air.  The harp is used because of it's history as a healing instrument.
