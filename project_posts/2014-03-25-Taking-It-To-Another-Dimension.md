I want to add additional depth to the project and to the visualizations.  I will include in the installation, floor to ceiling strings, through which viewers and participants will be able to walk while observing the projected visualizations.

The strings will catch the light of the projection, casting shadows on the floor and walls, reflecting the visualizations and creating another dimension. Strings will be made from a plastic or glass fiber optic.

There will be twelve strings, representing the chromatic scale.  The strings will be well spread out, as the space allows.

This sketch gives an idea of how the space will be set up.  The fiber strings are shown with a simplified projection.  More thought will be given to the processing of the sounds and the final visualizations.
