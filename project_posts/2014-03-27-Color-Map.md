In experimenting with the Web Audio API and the frequency analysis, I began to think about mapping frequencies to colors.  I am reminded of the chakra system and it's light energies in the body.

The String Theory Project will distill the sound frequencies into the 12 notes of the chromatic scale.  The frequencies will be mapped to colors, corresponding to parts of the body and touching on the harp as a healing medium.

This sketch demonstrates the idea.
