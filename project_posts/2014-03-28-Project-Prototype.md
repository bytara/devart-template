I have been working through some code and putting the pieces of technology together. Great news, code tests have gone well and I have put up a v.1.0 Prototype.

Now will come the fun part of working through some math and getting creative with audio analysis and visualizations.  I wanted to be certain that inputs, the web audio context analyzer and drawing outputs were all working well together before advancing to this next step.

With these pieces in place, I'm very excited about the possibilities going forward.
