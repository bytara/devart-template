Using technology to explore the hidden powers beneath the strings.

## Description
The String Theory Project is an interactive art installation that merges music, sound, code and technology. The String Theory Project installation will use a traditional stringed instrument, the harp, known for it's healing vibrations, to map and visualize sound waves.  The emphasis will be on connections to the body and mind.

The project will investigate the transformative powers of harp sounds, gaining insights into sound energies.  Mathematics, music, vibration, visualization and mapping sound techniques will recast harp vibrations into something physical, something we can see.

I am an artist, coder, mathematician and most recently, harpist.  When I first heard the harp instrument live, I was personally touched by the angelic sounds of the instrument, giving inspiration to the project and excitement to it's development.
